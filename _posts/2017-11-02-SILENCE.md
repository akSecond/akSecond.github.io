<center>Yeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter</center> 

​    

<center>Cause all my life, I've been fighting</center>

​    

<center>Never felt a feeling of comfort</center>

​    

<center>All this time, I've been hiding </center>

​    

<center>And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah</center>

​    

<center>I'm so used to sharing</center>

​    

<center>Love only left me alone</center>

​    

<center>But I'm at one with the silence</center>

​      

<center>I found peace in your violence</center>

​        

<center>Can't tell me there's no point in trying</center>

​    

<center>I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

<center>I found peace in your violence</center>

​    

<center>Can't tell me there's no point in trying</center>

​    

<center>I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long</center>

​    

<center>And I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

<center>And I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

​      

<center>I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

<center>I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

​      

<center>I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors</center>

​    

<center>My whole life, I've felt like a burden</center>

​    

<center>I think too much, and I hate it</center>

​    

<center>I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring</center>

​    

<center>Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence</center>

​    

​      

<center>I found peace in your violence</center>

​    

<center>Can't tell me there's no point in trying</center>

​    

<center>I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long</center>

​    

<center>I found peace in your violence</center>

​    

<center>Can't tell me there's no point in trying</center>

​    

<center>I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long</center>

​    

​      

<center>I found peace in your violence</center>

​    

<center>Can't tell me there's no point in trying</center>

​    

<center>I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long</center>
