**Toolkit for Professional Web Development**

- A computer
- A text editor
- Web browsers
- A graphics editor(I've never focus on this aspect before I write this page), such as **GIMP**, **PhotoShop**
- A version control system, like **GIT**
- A FTP program, **GIT** can also approach this goal
- An automation system like **Grunt** or **Gulp**

**Plan your web**

Choosing assets which will eventually appear on your webpage, such as *Theme color*, *Images*, *Font*. I've never focus on font disigning before I write this page, but now I know its importance, **Google Fonts** can be your market.

*What's the meaning of 'Serif'*

**Dealing with files**

When you're building a website, you need dealing with files, for one reason of that is you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another,  for another, a definite structure will make a sense for your work

*Watch out when you name your files*

all files should name with lowcase, and separate words with dash(-) rather than underscores(_)
